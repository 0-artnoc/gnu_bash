This document details the changes between this version, bash-4.3-beta, and the
previous version, bash-4.3-alpha.

1.  Changes to Bash

a.  Fixed a bug in the prompt directory name "trimming" code that caused
    memory corruption and garbled the results.

b.  Fixed a bug that caused single quotes that resulted from $'...' quoting
    in the replacement portion of a double-quoted ${word/pat/rep} expansion
    to be treated as quote characters.

c.  Fixed a bug that caused assignment statements preceding a command word to
    result in assignment statements following a declaration command to not be
    expanded like assignment statements.

d.  Fixed a bug with variable search order in the presence of local variables
    with the same name as variables in the temporary environment supplied to
    a shell function.

e.  Fixed a bug that caused constructs like 1<(2) to be interpreted as process
    substitutions even in an arithmetic context.

f.  Fixed several cases where `invisible' variables (variables with attributes
    but no values, which are technically unset) were treated incorrectly.

g.  Fixed a bug that caused group commands in pipelines that were not the
    last element to not run the EXIT trap.

h.  Fixed a bug that caused `unset -n' to not unset a nameref variable in
    certain cases.

i.  Fixed the nameref circular reference checking to be less strict and only
    disallow a nameref variable with the same value as its name at the global
    scope.

j.  Fixed a bug that caused trap handlers to be executed recursively,
    corrupting internal data structures.

k.  Fixed a bug that could result in bash not compiling if certain options were
    not enabled.

l.  Fixed a bug that caused the arithmetic expansion code to attempt variable
    assignments when operator precedence prohibited them.

m.  Word expansions like ${foo##bar} now understand indirect variable references.

n.  Fixed a bug that caused `declare -fp name' to not display a function 
    definition.

o.  Fixed a bug that caused asynchronous child processes to modify the stdin
    file pointer when bash was using it to read a script, which modified the
    parent's value as well.

2.  Changes to Readline

a.  Fixed a bug in vi mode that caused the arrow keys to set the saved last
    vi-mode command to the wrong value.

b.  Fixed a bug that caused double-quoted strings to be scanned incorrectly
    when being used as the value of a readline variable assignment.

c.  Fixed a bug with vi mode that prevented `.' from repeating a command
    entered on a previous line (command).

d.  Fixed a bug that could cause completion to core dump if it was interrupted
    by a signal.

e.  Readline now sends the meta-key enable string to the terminal if the
    terminal has been successfully initialized.

f.  Readline now calls the signal hook after resizing the terminal when it
    receives a SIGWINCH.

g.  Fixed a bug that could cause the history list code to perform an out-of-
    bounds array reference if the history list is empty.

3.  New Features in Bash

a.  Shells started to run process substitutions now run any trap set on EXIT.

b.  There is now a configure-time option to enable the globasciiranges option
    by default.

c.  The read builtin now checks its first variable argument for validity before
    trying to read any input.
